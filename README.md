## Install required packages

### 1. Install uv (if not already installed)
```bash
pip install uv
```

### 2. Install dependencies
`uv` automatically manages virtual environments and dependencies.
```bash
uv sync
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all packages from your `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`.

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database configuration:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

### 4. Initialize Alembic (First time only)

If Alembic is not yet set up in the project:
```bash
alembic init alembic
```

Then configure `alembic/env.py` to import your models and database settings.

### 5. Run database migrations

Apply all pending migrations to set up your database schema:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

**Note:** Always run migrations before starting the application, especially after pulling new code or creating new models.

## 6. Running project in your dev machine

Run
```bash
uv run fastapi dev app/main.py
```

Access it at `localhost:8000`

## Working with Database Migrations

### Creating a new migration after model changes
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

### Applying migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rolling back a migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Check current migration status
```bash
alembic current
```
